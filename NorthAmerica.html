<!--INGRIDIENTS LIST-->
<h4>Ingidients (Serving 6):</h4>
<li> 2	pounds	freshly ground chuck, (at least 80% lean, a.k.a. 80/20)</li>
<li> 1	tablespoon	onion powder</li>

<!--METHODS-->
<h4>Methods (Serving 6):</h4>
<li> In a large bowl, mix ground beef, onion powder, salt and pepper until just combined. Do not overmix, or your patties will be tough. </li>
<li> Divide into six portions and form patties, without pressing too hard. They should be uniform in thickness. Smooth out any cracks using your fingers.</li>
<li> Preheat your grill, grill pan or cast-iron skillet to high heat and add burger patties. If using a grill, cover with the lid.</li>
<li> Cook until the crust that forms on the bottom of the burger releases it from the pan or grate â€” about 2 minutes. </li>
<li> When burgers lift up easily, flip, add two slices of cheese to each, close lid if using a grill, and cook on the other side for another 2-3 minutes for medium to medium rare. </li>
<li> Remove burgers with a sturdy metal spatula and transfer to a plate. Allow to rest for several minutes, then transfer to buns.</li>
<li> Garnish as desired and serve immediately. </li>
