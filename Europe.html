<li>Your choice of vegetables (carrots, parsnips,cauliflower, brussel sprouts)</li>
<li>1 bag of oven potatoes</li>

<li>Optional sauces (mint sauce, wholegrain mustard, apple sauce)</li>
<!--METHODS-->
<h3>Methods:</h3>
<li>Click <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-cook-the-perfect-sunday-roast-435902"> here </a> for a guide on cooking the perfect roast meat for your chosen meat.</li>
<li>To get those potatoes fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, place them in a colander and rattle them around – this will help to make the skin crispy.</li>
<li>The golden rule is that you must cover your spuds in olive oil, butter, goose or duck fat for that wonderful golden colour.</li>
<li>While they are roasting, baste them in the fat every so often to keep them moist and make them extra crunchy. Once cooked, season them with sea salt and black pepper. </li>
<li>For the vegetables, wash, prep, and cut your vegetables, and season them to be roasted in the oven.</li>
<li>For the Yorkshire, Whisk the eggs, flour, milk, 25ml of water and a pinch of sea salt to a smooth batter, rest, then oven for 5 minutes on gas 7.</li>
<li>While the meat is cooking and resting you can get started on the gravy using the juices in the pan. Thicken this by mixing 1 tablespoon of gravy granules and hot water</li>

<!--INGRIDIENTS LIST-->
<h4>Ingidients:</h4>
<li>1x pound beef tenderloin (cut into roughly 2-inch chunks)</li>
<li>1x bacon slice, (finely chopped)</li>
<li>1x 10oz cremini mushrooms (quartered)</li>
<li>1x cup frozen pearl onions</li>
<li>1x tablespoon clarified butter/canola/safllower oil</li>
<li>1x teaspoon fresh thyme (chopped)</li>
<li>1x tablespoon tomato paste</li>
<li>2x large garlic cloves (finely chopped)</li>
<li>1x tablespoon tomato paste</li>
<li>1x 1/2 cup red wine (cote du rhone, burgundy or pinot noir)</li>
<li>1x 1x cup low-sodium beef broth</li>
<li>1x 1x tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
<li>Fresh thyme sprigs (for garnish)</li>
<!--METHODS-->
<h4>Methods:</h4>
<li>Place pearl onions in a small microwave-proof bowl and cover lightly with a paper towel. Microwave for 3-4 minutes, or until cooked all the way through. Set aside.</li>
<li>Remove the tenderloin from the refrigerator at least 20 minutes before cooking and cut into 2″ chunks–setting aside one small chunk</li>
<li>Finely chop the reserved piece of meat.</li>
<li>Pat dry the remaining beef chunks with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper on all sides.</li>
<li>Heat a large, wide non-reactive skillet over medium high heat. Melt the clarified butter (or oil) and swirl to coat the pan.</li>
<li>Add the large beef chunks to the pan (in multiple batches if necessary to avoid over crowding the pan) and quickly brown them on all sides.</li>
<li>Remove the beef from the pan and set aside in a stainless steel bowl.</li>
<li>Once all the beef chunks have been browned, add the finely diced beef and bacon to the pan, stirring frequently. At this point, the bottom of the pan should have nice browning.</li>
<li>Add the mushrooms and saute until lightly brown, for roughly 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
<li>Add the garlic, thyme, and pinch of sugar and stir together until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and cook for an additional minute or two, stirring constantly.</li>
<li>Remove the pan from the heat (temporarily) and pour in the wine.</li>
<li>Put back on the heat and bring to a boil, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan with the back of a wooden spoon to release all the browned bits. Reduce the wine by half.</li>
<li>Add the pearled onions and broth and bring to a boil for a minute or so. Whisk together the flour and water in a small bowl and add to the pan–stirring constantly.</li>
<li>Season with salt and pepper. Add the browned beef chunks and continue to cook over medium heat until the beef is medium-rare, roughly 2-3 minutes.  Serve with mashed potatoes and garnish with fresh thyme leaves.</li>
