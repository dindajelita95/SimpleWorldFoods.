<p></p>
<p>Fast, junk, processed -- when it comes to American food, the country is best known for the stuff that's described by words better suited to greasy, grinding industrial output. But citizens of the USA have an impressive appetite for good stuff, too.<wbr> So we will narrow down to our top 5 favourites all across Europe!</wbr></p>

<!--METHODS-->
<h4> Methods (Serving 8):</h4>
<li> The day before, place the black beans in a large pan, cover with plenty of water and put the lid on.</li>
<li> Do the same with the chunks of pig’s ear, tail and trotter, then leave both to soak overnight. </li>
<li> The next day, place the black beans pan on the hob, topping up with water to cover the beans if needed, then bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
<li> Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onions and garlic.</li>
<li> Heat a splash of olive oil in a very large casserole pan on a medium-high heat and drain</li>
<li> Add the chunks of pig’s ear, tail and trotter and pork belly and fry for 15 minutes, or until golden and gnarly. </li>
<li> At this point, go in with three-quarters of the chopped onions, and all the garlic, bay leaves and paprika. </li>
<li> Slice up the bacon and chorizo 2cm thick, cut the ribs up, then add it all to the pan and cook for 15 minutes, stirring regularly. </li>
<li> When the time’s up, pour the beans into the meat pan with enough of their cooking water to cover everything nicely.</li>
<li> Cook on a low heat for 3 hours, or until the meat is tender, stirring occasionally, and topping up with a little more water, if needed.</li>
<li> To make the salsa, peel the onion, deseed the tomatoes and pepper, then very finely chop them with the top leafy half of the parsley, mixing as you go.</li>
<li> In a bowl, dress with the lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and vinegar, then taste and season to perfection. </li>
<li> Tear off the leaves of the spring greens, roll up and slice them 1cm thick, cook the remaining chopped onions and splash olive oil in a large pan on a high heat for 5 minutes. </li>
<li> Season the feijoada to taste, then serve with fluffy rice, your spring greens, salsa and plenty of cold beers. To be truly authentic, you want a little bowl of toasted cassava flour on the side to dip each mouthful in, and some hot pickled chillies. Santos also recommends a few fresh wedges of orange to cut through the intensity of the sauce – delicious.</li>
